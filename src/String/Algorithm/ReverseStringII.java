//Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
//If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
//Output: "bacdfeg"
//Example 2:
//Input: s =gi "abcd", k = 2
//Output: "bacd"
